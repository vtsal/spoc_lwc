    Architecture description:
        Implementation of SpoC-64, with c=128, b=192, n=128, and t=64. Basic iterative architecture where 1 round of the sLiSCP-light-[192] permutation is executed in 1 clock cycle.

    Key setup time:
        0
        
    Execution time of authenticated encryption:
        219 + (Na*109) + (Nm*111)
    Execution time of authenticated decryption:
        219 + (Na*109) + (Nc*111)
